Actually, ignore the dates in this project's readme. Teach says just do the first three iterations tonight.

We're allowed to do more, but don't feel pressured to go further. If there's time, there's nothing wrong with doing all of them tonight... if there's time. Don't stress on doing more than just the first three.
